                My time as a Junior Software Developer at Apple, though brief, was an incredible learning experience.
                 I got the opportunity to work alongside talented engineers and contribute to real-world projects, even on a small scale. 
                 From debugging to implementing minor features, 
                 I gained a deeper understanding of how large-scale software development works and how Apple delivers such polished products. 
                 While my role was limited, 
                the experience gave me insight into cutting-edge technology and inspired me to keep growing as a developer.
