If this ever\n                    changes, however, a link to the game will be added here.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n                <h2>Stop the Scroll</h2>\n                <br />\n                <p>\n                    While working I spend a lot of time on GitHub\n                    issue pages looking for answers and solutions to problems I\n                    had run into. I would always find myself sifting though the\n                    comments trying to find the right answer, which usually had\n                    the most upvotes and positive reactions. With that\n                    information, I decided to create a very simple chrome\n                    extension that would sift through all the comments on the\n                    page, sort them by positive reactions, and then allow you to\n                    traverse them from most positive reactions to least positive\n                    reactions.\n                </p>\n                <br />\n                <div className=\"captioned-image\">\n                    <VideoAsset src={scroll} />\n                    <p style={styles.caption}>\n                        <sub>\n                            <b>Figure 3:</b> Skip the Scroll in action, finding\n                            the highest rated comments and scrolling right to\n                            them\n                        </sub>\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                    The extension is open source and currently released on the\n                    Chrome web store. Skip the Scroll is obviously not a project\n                    with massive scope, but was fun to make and dive into the\n                    world of browser extensions. I wanted to showcase since it's\n                    a developer tool and I wanna give it some visibility for\n                    those who might find it useful.\n                </p>\n                <br />\n                <h3>Links:</h3>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <a\n                            rel=\"noreferrer\"\n                            target=\"_blank\"\n                            href=\"https://github.com/lopa-ok/Stop-The-Scroll\"\n                        >\n                            <p>\n                                <b>[GitHub]</b> - Stop the Scroll Repository\n                            </p>\n                        </a>\n                    </li>\n                    \n                </ul>\n                <p>\n                    If you are a developer and have also found yourself\n                    scrolling through github comment after github comment saying\n                    \"i also have this problem...\", then I highly recommend you\n                    check out Skip the Scroll to save you some of your precious\n                    time.
