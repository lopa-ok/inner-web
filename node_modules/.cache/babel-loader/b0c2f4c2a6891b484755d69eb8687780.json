The game ceased development in\n                    2019 because we unfortunately i had packed school\n                    schedules and was unable to find the time to work on it.\n                </p>\n                <br />\n                <div className=\"captioned-image\">\n                    <VideoAsset src={saga} />\n                    <div style={styles.caption}>\n                        <p>\n                            <sub>\n                                <b>Figure 2: </b> Reloaded Rampart Gameplay\n                                demo, featuring the main character along with a\n                                few of our grunt and dasher enemies.\n                            </sub>\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                    Reloaded Rampart was a really fun project to work on and\n                    had a multitude of challenges. An interesting challenge that\n                    you may not even notice was the rotation of objects such as\n                    the players weapon. Rotating pixel art is a very difficult\n                    thing to do because in the world of pixels you are dealing\n                    with such a little amount of information. Even a single\n                    misplaced pixel can cause a sprite to read in a totally\n                    different and unintended way. To deal with this we developed\n                    an algorithm to prioritize outlines, while rotating the\n                    insides with a simple Nearest Neighbor algorithm. Doing so\n                    resulted in a relatively readable sprite when rotating\n                    sprites. It was a surprisingly difficult challenge as it\n                    intersected both art and programming, but was fun to work on\n                    overall.\n                </p>\n                <br />\n                \n                <p>\n                    Unfortunately, the game currently is not in a releasable\n                    state and so there is no demo available online. If this ever\n                    changes, however, a link to the game will be added here.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n                <h2>Stop the Scroll</h2>\n                <br />\n                <p>\n                    While working I spend a lot of time on GitHub\n                    issue pages looking for answers and solutions to problems I\n                    had run into.

With that\n                    information, I decided to create a very simple chrome\n                    extension that would sift through all the comments on the\n                    page, sort them by positive reactions, and then allow you to\n                    traverse them from most positive reactions to least positive\n                    reactions.\n                </p>\n                <br />\n                <div className=\"captioned-image\">\n                    <VideoAsset src={scroll} />\n                    <p style={styles.caption}>\n                        <sub>\n                            <b>Figure 3:</b> Skip the Scroll in action, finding\n                            the highest rated comments and scrolling right to\n                            them\n                        </sub>\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                    The extension is open source and currently released on the\n                    Chrome web store. Skip the Scroll is obviously not a project\n                    with massive scope, but was fun to make and dive into the\n                    world of browser extensions. I wanted to showcase since it's\n                    a developer tool and I wanna give it some visibility for\n                    those who might find it useful.\n                </p>\n                <br />\n                <h3>Links:</h3>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <a\n                            rel=\"noreferrer\"\n                            target=\"_blank\"\n                            href=\"https://github.com/lopa-ok/Stop-The-Scroll\"\n                        >\n                            <p>\n                                <b>[GitHub]</b> - Stop the Scroll Repository\n                            </p>\n                        </a>\n                    </li>\n                    \n                </ul>\n                <p>\n                    If you are a developer and have also found yourself\n                    scrolling through github comment after github comment saying\n                    \"i also have this problem...\", then I highly recommend you\n                    check out Skip the Scroll to save you some of your precious\n                    time.
